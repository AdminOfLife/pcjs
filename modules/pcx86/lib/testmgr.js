/*
 * Overview
 * --------
 * 
 * This module is being created to send a series of automated commands to a machine via
 * a serial port, and to optionally verify the responses to those commands.  It is designed
 * to be loaded by a Node server-side script and communicate with another machine's serial port
 * using one of the Node server's serial ports (and the Node SerialPort package).  It is also
 * designed to be loaded by the browser, and communicate with a PCjs machine's serial port
 * using PCjs' own SerialPort interfaces.
